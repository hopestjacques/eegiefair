I tried to get this working for a few days but somehow I can't.Basically I have a Java Spring application inside a docker container which should be able to deploy sibling containers. So I mounted the "/var/run/docker.sock" from my host (Windows 10 Pro with Docker Desktop) to my container with "-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock". I also use supervisord because I run a mongodb inside the same container Every time I try to launch one world, it works for maybe ten seconds, then crashes. How do I fix this?

I feel bad for starting another thread about this because I've seen so many but literally no solution I've seen so far has worked even once, either that or I just didn't understand what everyone was talking about. I'm getting so so frustrated. I've had the game for about a week I'd say, it's started perfectly fine several times before, one day, I click on my launcher and my loading icon shows up for a split second then disappears, and nothing happens. I've tried reinstalling the launcher Just got the game cant even open it because it crashes constantly. amp#x200B; Here is the crash log: \# \# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: \# \# EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x00000000649401b2, pid=6448, tid=7296 \# \# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0\_51-b16) (build 1.8.0\_51-b16) \# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.51-b03 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops) \# Problematic frame: \# C \ atio6. 
I'm running Windows 10 and am trying to install Forge and Optifine for Minecraft 1.13.2 (yeah im that sad one). I went to download Forge and install it, but for some reason the Jar files do absolutely nothing. occasionally command prompt will flash for a half a second, spent the past few hours on google trying to find a result and nothing has helped so far. Here's what I've tried already: Checked for Windows 10 updates (No updates existed) Installing JRE / JDK 8 (64bit) Using 3rd party. My game keeps crashing after I installed SEUS. I checked the error log and I don't think it has to do with RAM. Originally, it was just a black screen, so I put this code (#extension GL\_ARB\_shader\_lod: enable) in the "final" and "composite" fsh files which apparently according to the chat box had errors. Ever since I put the code in the game always crashes. I have the correct version of Optifine and the shaderpack as well. The crash log is down below amp#x200B; \# A fatal error Hello. Hopefully I can get some help. I apologize if it's the wrong subreddit. I've googled to no end and haven't found anything. Windows 10 with brand new install of JRE 8, JDK 8, Netbeans 10. I created a new JavaFX project, the default Hello World app. When I run it, it can't find a class and asks me to choose one, but it gets stuck loading the classes. I select that "Initializing view, please wait." option and run it, then the error in comes up. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I call my Grandma an old woman, and she'd probably agree, in fact I often address her as t'old lass, I see her almost every day as I have done most of my life, she's always been there for me. Which is why I do everything I possibly can for her, and one of those things is seeing to her technological needs. Until the last 12 years she's shunned computer technology, it was only in her 70s she discovered what it could do for her, she's had opportunity. During a house move in my teens Okay so im making a 1.7.10 modpack and it keeps crashing on startup. i cant figure out the issue from the logs and i was wondering if someone here could make sense of it. The pack has 47 mods on it with some wildcard mods that arent staples that you'd see in every pack but eveything else is mostly that.

Hi, so I'm having a lot of issues with setting this up and solving all the problems, mainly because I'm new to this. after I've solved all of my previous problems this one popped up, I've been trying to research and fix it my self but none of the things I've tried worked. This is my pom.xml file: (Yes I know it is a mess, Sorry) lt?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?gt ltproject xmlns=" xmlns:xsi=". So, when I try to start 1.13, the window opens like usual, but then the game crashes. I've tried all the YouTube videos and forums, but nothing works. Can anyone help me?

I recently wiped my 10 year-old desktop that used to run Windows Vista, and is now dual boot with distros Ubuntu and Bodhi. They've both been running great with web browsing, GIMP, and some other applications, but today I was using LibreOffice Writer for the first time on Bodhi, and when I tried to save the file my monitor turned into a bunch of weird colors and the computer seemed like it crashed (I had to hard reboot). This has happened numerous times when I tried to recreate the problem;. ive tried to research this but ive come up with nothing ive updated my PC+ graphics card, ive uninstalled and reinstalled minecraft, ive restarted my PC, ive used the installer to repair it, ive checked to make sure my PC has minidumps on but still minecraft crashes on launch before or rarely a little after i reach the title screen. i have no idea what to do now and i would appreciate some help. edit it was working fine yesterday. here is the error log: \# \# A fatal error has been detected.

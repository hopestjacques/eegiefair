                            <p>Драйвера видеокарт Intel. Очень и очень редко пишу комментарии, но на этом сайте был вынужден сделать это трижды – дюже полезным оказался сайт для простого человека. EDIT: I needed to apply the ACS override patch to break up the IOMMU group the GPU is in. Still not working fully, but a step in the right direction. amp#x200B; So I've hit a wall here and am unsure what to do. I'm attempting dGPU passthrough on a Dell 7559 into some VMs. I've successfully gotten the device to passthrough, it's been recognized, and the NVIDIA drivers install and get to the point of requesting a reboot. After that, error 43. amp#x200B; I'm guessing this is an issue В новой версии разработчик упаковал драйвер в автоматический инсталлятор, поэтому установить драйвер сможет пользователь с любым уровнем компьютерных навыков. A couple weeks ago I finally got around to setting up a libvirt vm with passthrough. Everything was working great and stable until now. --- I am running Antergos with the linux-vfio kernel (4.20.1) for the ACS override patch. I decided to update some packages yesterday, being careful to avoid the linux-vfio and kernel updates; I missed libvirt in the mix though. So then libvirt updates from 4.9.0 to 5.0.0 and after a host reboot my Windows 10 domain is no longer starting. I don't think Не секрет, что понять, насколько та или иная видеокарта быстрее и лучше - очень не просто. So in trying to make it that while in "intel driver" mode the screen would not do the dreaded "screen tearing"; I placed this file: amp#x200B; Section "Device" Identifier "Intel Graphics" Driver "intel" Option "TripleBuffer" "true" Option "TearFree" "true" EndSection in this location/file: \`/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel-graphics.conf\`. amp#x200B; But, when you then try to switch to nvidia mode, the laptop Специализированный софт для ноутбуков. Обсуждение проблем функционирования стандартного. My issue has been solved! This thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/9dr5sj/q35_chipset_inhibits_your_pcie_bus_lane_to_11/) pointed me in the right direction: using the i440fx chipset. If you are smart enough to get the `libvirt` XML edit, go for that instead of having to re-create your VM (or even smarter enough to have set all this up with raw `qemu`)! EDIT: Ok, I got the XML working -- I had a permissions issue with one of the files unrelated to the issue at hand; 
It looks pretty whacked (https://i.imgur.com/sxW3jL8.jpg) and we can't figure it out. Only Connect does it, it displays 'broken' during launch with the logo folded in half and partially duplicated and the entire lesson is broken the way the picture shows. Of note, the chunks of picture displayed out of order stay in that configuration throughout the length of the file, changing to the next segment does not interfere with the way it wants to display. I've tried reformatting my hard drive several times and reinstalling RS, but all I get is a black screen when I open the NXT client. There's a black screen where the login page should be. I've tried it on Windows 7 and Windows 10. I'm beginning to suspect that it's not a software/Windows issue but a graphics card issue. I have integrated Intel graphics from like 2008 \(q35 express chipset graphics\). Does anyone else have these issues on integrated Intel graphics? I've tried updating I am trying to pass through the only GPU in my Server to a VM. My host is using Debian Stretch with UEFI boot and Linux 4.14. The configuration is as follows: Hardware: AMD Ryzen 7 AsRock AB350M ATI Radeon HD 7770 (having separate IOMMU group) OS configuration: /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf # ids of VGA and Audio device of GPU options vfio-pci ids=1002:683d,1002:aab0 /etc/initramfs-tools/modules vfio_pci vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_virqfd /etc/default/grub. My pc is pretty basic: https://support.hp.com/de-de/product/hp-compaq-dc7800-convertible-minitower-pc/3459240/drivers (core 2 duo, intel graphic chipset Q35.) Yet it runs older versions of mame like a charme (win XP). Right now i have 119 installed and most of the games up to early 90s work without an issue. I tried 160 and it does runs OK but 1.81-195 won't work. I installed two different OS (win xp 32Bit amp Win7 64Bit) and it won't start (small windows pops up but then nothing). Specs: Processor: I7-4790K Mobo: Asus z87-g45 Graphics card(s):GTX 760 and RX-480, eventually went with on board and RX-480 Ram: 16GB Corsair vengeance Hard drive: 3TB WD green and 2TB WD black, main OS on a 250GB Samsung Evo SSD OS: Debian Stretch 64-bit attempted virtualized OS: Windows 7 ultimate Having used Linux for over 4 years I thought this would only take me a few hours at most to do. But, I ran into roadblock after roadblock, errors that NO ONE on EARTH So I've been using this (https://github.com/qntmpkts/chroagh) script to try and get a working arch chroot setup and it gets installed just fine, but when I try to enter the chroot I get this: Entering /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/arch. chown: invalid user: 'messagebus:messagebus' _XSERVTransmkdir: Owner of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to root X.Org X Server 1.18.4 Release Date: 2016-07-19 X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0 Build Operating Syste. 
Another Update 2016-08-19 I've recently just upgraded the GPU in this server to a brand new EVGA GTX 1060 SC. Everything went swimmingly and this card is an absolute monster. New Firestrike score: New Firestrike Extreme score: What I did and what I noticed: Firstly, I ran DDU in the guest VM in full safe mode with the "Clean and Shutdown" option. No problems here. Also ran a full "apt-get dist-upgrade" I have tried dozens of configurations already, trying to passthrough either the 980 Ti or the 1060, but they all invariably end up the same way: the GPU gets stuck on power state D3, apparently before the guest can fully boot, and I need to reboot the host before I can do anything else. I've seen this D3 issue isn't uncommon after shutting down the guest, but I haven't seen anyone that can't even pass the GPU once before it's stuck. Host setup: Ryzen 7 1800X @ 4GHz, Crosshair I'm having issues with a Sapphire RX480 Nitro+ 8GB OC passed to a w10 guest. Passthrough functions correctly as I am able to install/boot w10. Installing crimson drivers results in black screen, and black screen after windows logo on boot. Safe mode works but then the driver is not loaded. Card is functionally OK as I installed a native w10 and ran some benchmarks. - Qemu 2.6 (emulating Q35 chipset) - Asus Z170, newest BIOS - Intel Skylake 6700 (kernel patch for io group isolation not needed). After too many frustrations with Compiz, I decided that I'd give Openbox a try. I've read the wiki page at least three or four times now and I feel that I have done everything that is necessary to set Openbox up. But it seems that no matter what I do, I can't get it to work. Whenever I execute `startx`, I just get a black screen with a mouse. I can't click or do anything other than move the mouse, so I have to press my computer's power button to shut it down. `~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log`. 
I've tried everything I could find on the internet to fix this. I made sure my graphics driver was at the latest version. I tried running it in compatibility mode, I tried running the installer in compatibility mode, I installed the .MSI version, and I removed any possible invalid JVM arguments, but I still get the "pixel format not accelerated" error when I try to launch the game. Before I installed Windows 10 everything worked just fine so its not likely to be an outdated graphics card. I recently got an older computer with a Core 2 Duo E8400 and Q35 chipset integrated graphics. For some reason, the desktop effects in Cinnamon are somewhat laggy, and scrolling in Firefox is really laggy, as well as fullscreen video playback. However, Windows 10 on the same machine works perfectly. All desktop effects run at a smooth 60FPS on the 1600x1200 monitor. There is no noticeable lag anywhere. I have noticed the same thing in other computers. My main laptop has a Core i3 3227u So, last night I was trying out the new Vulkan driver on my laptop, and when I installed it and rebooted, I got errors involving. couldn't find rgb glx visual or fbconfig Failed to start Wait for Plymouth Boot Screen to Quit So, after restarting, I can only boot in terminal mode or else I get the Sad Computer of Death for linux, with errors like A problem has occurred and the system can't recover. Please log out and try again. - Log Out - with my Xorg.0.log I'm wondering if my PC can update to windows 10. I'm currently on Windows 7. If so where can I download the drivers? dell.com doesn't have them. Specs: Dell Optiplex 755 CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 3.16 Ram: 4gb Gpu: Intel Q35 Express Chipset Family (Integrated) Hello, just looking for some low power GPU advice to do an upgrade. Mostly looking for upgrade for gaming. Goals would be games along the lines Skyrim, ACIV/ACU, Total War at about 30-40fps at 1080 with moderate AA if possible. Willing to live with lower resolution to save price. Have taken a look at some game play videos for quality of 6570 and they're alright, but looking to see what's available with newer cards (although how much newer really doesn't seem to make a difference considering. I just loaded a clean copy of Windows 7 onto an HP dc7800p small form factor system. I am tearing my hair out trying to find the missing PCI Simple Communications Controller driver. I know I should be looking for the HECI or Chipset driver, but I cannot find any driver on HP's website. I also tried searching Intel's driver page and got nothing, just Q35 Chipset Graphics drivers. This is the information that AIDA64 gives me about the device: Driver Description: PCI Simple Communications Contr. Hi /r/techsupport. I recently bought a used HD 3850 video card for my secondary computer. I installed it on the second computer, plugged the 6 pin pci e cable and started the computer, but for some reason there's no video on the monitor. I'm using DVI cable for the display connection since the HD 3850 I have only has 2x DVI and a S Video Output. I tried plugging it to both DVI ports just in case but still no video on the monitor. The fans spin and seems to be running normally (no fan going. </p>

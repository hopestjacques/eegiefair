For more general information about Evince. As of today, when installing Evince document viewer the forked version by Mint gets installed instead. This version has a messed up gui look because mintdevs doesn't like the new gnome window borders or whatever, and has adopted something of their own. I don't like the forked version because the menubar takes up a whole row, making the top panel unnecessary large. I tried building from source, but encountered too many build problems regarding versions to bother continuing. So, does anyone.

Hello, could you please suggest me a lightweight PDF reader (possibly also EPUB and other formats too) that's better than built-in Document Viewer in Xubuntu? I have 2 GB RAM and 1.2 GHz single core CPU, Document Viewer works fine for most documents however some heavier ones tend to bog it down, so I'd like to know if Evince or other software would be more efficient than it.

A version of Evince (Document Viewer 2.28.2) came with the version of Linux that I have. But there is a major problem (see below), and I thought that getting the latest version of Evince would solve these problems since other versions of Evince don't seem to have the problem. Is there any way to open (certain) PDF documents that contain forms? Opening this particular PDF in evince or qpdfview results in page stating: To view the full contents of this document, you need a later version of the PDF viewer. You can upgrade to the latest version of Adobe Reader from www.adobe.com/product/acrobat/readstep2.html For further support, go to www.adobe.com/support/products/acrreader.html But Adobe doesn't support linux any more.

I tried getting the last deb-file available (that being AdbeRdr9.5.5-1\_i386linux\_enu.deb) and then installing it via GDebi (and installing whatever dependencies it stated were needed), but to no avail. I also ran "dpkg --add-archite. Hi All Anyone else having problems printing statements from Starling Bank? Downloading them is difficult because my phone (Android 7.0; Galaxy S6) asks for an app to do that rather than something like Firefox which just downloads them to the download directory. evince / Document viewer (3.30.2) shows the preview ok with all text but only prints the non text (the lines and bitmap logo). I've never seen this happen before with any pdf I've either created from, say LibreOffice, or received. 
Since evince doesn't have a fixed window name, I can't seen to set it open in a particular workspace by adding `assign class="evince" 3` to my i3config, I even tried setting class to other names such as document viewer and other names. Any help?. New to Ubuntu and Linux in general and at some point while using the default document viewer, Evince, the chapter view on the side vanished. I haven't been able to find anything through the settings or internet searches. If you have any hints even if its just to tell me what to look for that would be super helpful. Thanks. Hi /r/gnome , I love Evince; along with Zathura (https://github.com/pwmt/zathura) for more minimal pdf viewing, it's my favorite document viewer. I have a question about when I scroll using the CTRL key. When I use the "J" or "K" to navigate it acts just like the up and down arrow keys would. When I use CTRL+Up or CTRL+Down, it scrolls the same amount but adds a smooth animation to it. I was wondering what this is as the same thing happens in Zathura. I'd like to see if I can replicate. How can I configure AUCTeX to use Emacs default PDF viewer to sync LaTeX documents when compiling them instead of viewing them in an external PDF viewer like Evince. Hi everyone, Yes, I've found my question being asked before. But the answers were generally lacking. I am looking for a good pdf viewer. A lot of my pdf are study material, which means I need annotations to make simple remarks, highlights to mark sections and bookmarks to quickly jump to question and answer section at the back. Furthermore, often a single page should be turned (instead of turning the entire document sideways). Bonus points for signature support. Mostly I got Okular recommended. 
I'm having a weird issue that seems to have popped up: every time I C-c C-c in auctex and RET, emacs complies my latex document and also moves to the next line. In other words, it seems that RET is registering both in the buffer for the command and in the main buffer where my text is. I'm a compulsive compiler, checking that each maths line does what I want it to do, and would like to C-c C-c without the cursor jump. I don't think I've noticed this before and it seems like it doesn't happen. I recently had to do a clean install on a laptop, and I used it as an opportunity to really assess which programs where necessary for my everyday use. The following is a list of every program I installed. I tried to give a description of what they do, and why I chose them. It was too long unfortunately, so I am using this as a skeleton post and will post the details I originally wrote to go with it in the comments. I'll try to add a short description length permitting. Security This might be an unpopular opinion, however, after trying out a few Latex-plugins for vim, I came to the conclusion that there are better program suitable for writing tex files than vim. Short Intro: I consider myself a terminal user. I use tmux in combination with zsh to browse the file system comfortably, move and rename files, search files. Therefore I do a lot of editing right in the terminal, it's much faster than using editors or some special IDE, especially when switching languages. Hi! I've been using Arch Linux for a couple of months and I'm loving it, but on Wednesday (day 12), I have done a lot of updates and when I restarted the system the desktop didn't show any icon. The files are there, I've checked through the Terminal and the File Explorer. I use GNOME 3 with Arch Linux. I've tried to restart nautilus, install lidsgv (something like that) and gcr, but nothing happened. What can I do? LOG: 2016-10-12 22:51 PACMAN Running 'pacman -Syu' 2016-10-12 22:51 PACMA. 
I might be in the minority, but I actually prefer using Evince (the default PDF document viewer in Ubuntu) over other viewer options. But for whatever asinine reason, Evince no longer supports keybinding, which means that you can't change the stupid default page navigation that Evince uses: n (for next page) and p (for previous page). There's nothing online that I could find to change this in the current version of Evince, so I was able to create a workaround using the `xdotool` package. </p>
